1.  What are the observational units in this study?

        The observational units in this study are the two sections.

2. Identify the variables mentioned in the narrative paragraph and determine which are categorical and quantitative?  

        The categorical variable is "Sections". The quantitative variables are "Count" and "Score".

3. Create one variable to hold a subset of your data set that contains only the Regular Section and one variable for the Sports Section.  

4. Use the Plot function to plot each Sections scores and the number of students achieving that score. Use additional Plot Arguments to label the graph and give each axis an appropriate label. Once you have produced your Plots answer the following questions:  

    a. Comparing and contrasting the point distributions between the two section, looking at both tendency and consistency: Can you say that one section tended to score more points than the other? Justify and explain your answer.  
        
        The first observation I made after plotting both sections is that Sports section has a wider range of scores than the Regular 
        section. In the Sports section, students scored as low as 200 and as high as 395. In the Regular section, students scored as 
        low as 265 and as high as 380. These means that the Regular section were more consistent in their scores. In addition, the mean 
        for the Regular section was 335, while the mean for the Sports section was 306.92. On avergae the Regular section did better 
        than the Sports section. After that I did my own type of comparison. I first compared all the scores on a grading scale of 1-100 
        with 400 being equal to 100. That would mean a score of 360 or higher would be the same as 90 or higher which is a grade of A in 
        most schools. The Regular section has a count of 90 scores that had A's while the Sports section has 60 scores that were A's. 
        Additionally, a score lower than 70 would be considered failing in many courses in many schools. For these scores a grade of 70 
        is equal to a score of 280. The Regular section had a count of 20 scores lower than 280, while the Sports section had a count of 
        60 scores lower than 280. This is telling us that more students had A's and fewer students failed in the Regular section.
        
    b. Did every student in one section score more points than every student in the other section? If not, explain what a statistical tendency means in this context.  
    
        No, every student in one section didn't score more points than every student in the other section. However, more students in 
        the Regular section did score higher than students in the Sports section. One way to tell us this is by calculating the mean, 
        median, and mode. The mean, median, and mode of the Regular section are 335, 325, and 350 respectfully. The mean, median, and 
        mode of the Sports section are 306.92, 315, and 285/335 respectfully. The mean, median, and mode are higher in the Regular 
        section then those of the Sports section.
    
    c. What could be one additional variable that was not mentioned in the narrative that could be influencing the point distributions between the two sections.  
    
        One additional variable that was not mentioned in the narrative that could be influencing the point distributions between the 
        two sections are the sums of the counts of each section. After calculating them myself the Regular section has a sum count of 
        290 while the Sports section has a sum count of 260.
