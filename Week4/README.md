1. What are the observational units in this study?  

2. Identify the variables mentioned in the narrative paragraph and determine which are categorical and quantitative?  

3. Create one variable to hold a subset of your data set that contains only the Regular Section and one variable for the Sports Section.  

4. Use the Plot function to plot each Sections scores and the number of students achieving that score. Use additional Plot Arguments to label the graph and give each axis an appropriate label. Once you have produced your Plots answer the following questions:  
    a. Comparing and contrasting the point distributions between the two section, looking at both tendency and consistency: Can you say that one section tended to score more points than the other? Justify and explain your answer.  
    b. Did every student in one section score more points than every student in the other section? If not, explain what a statistical tendency means in this context.  
    c. What could be one additional variable that was not mentioned in the narrative that could be influencing the point distributions between the two sections.  


# 4.2 Exercise 2

Use the apply function on a variable in your dataset

Use the aggregate function on a variable in your dataset

Use the plyr function on a variable in your dataset â€“ more specifically, I want to see you split some data, perform a modification to the data, and then bring it back together

Check distributions of the data

Identify if there are any outliers

Create at least 2 new variables
